        <h2>My Journey with Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          As an IT student, my journey into web development started with a curiosity about how websites are built. What began as a simple interest quickly turned into a passion for creating dynamic digital experiences.

            I started with the basics, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have since expanded my skills to include responsive design and mobile app development with Flutter.

            Along the way, I’ve discovered the importance of combining technical skills with good design to create intuitive, user-friendly websites. I’m always looking to learn new technologies and take on new challenges, excited to continue growing as a web developer and create innovative solutions.

        <h2>Why I Chose IT as a Career</h2>
        <p>
          I chose IT as a career because of my fascination with technology and its ability to solve real world problems.

            From a young age, I was always curious about how things worked—whether it was tinkering with computers or exploring the digital world. As I grew older, I realized that technology is a powerful tool that shapes almost every aspect of our lives, and I wanted to be part of that transformation.

Web development, in particular, caught my attention because of the creativity it allows while still being grounded in logic and problem-solving. The idea of building something from scratch and making it accessible to people worldwide inspired me to pursue IT as a career. As an IT student, I’m excited to learn new skills, explore innovative technologies, and contribute to the ever-evolving tech industry. I believe IT offers endless opportunities for growth and the ability to make a meaningful impact, and I’m eager to continue this journey.

        <h2>My Favorite Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>
          As an aspiring web developer and IT student, I have developed a strong appreciation for several programming languages. Among my favorites are C and HTML/CSS.
        </p>
        <button class="read-more-btn">Read More</button>
        <div class="extra-content" style="display:none;">
          <p>
            C was one of the first languages I encountered, and I quickly developed a deep respect for its efficiency and versatility. It’s a powerful, low-level language that gives me a deeper understanding of how computers work at the hardware level. Working with C has sharpened my problem-solving skills and strengthened my foundation in programming.

On the other hand, HTML and CSS are essential tools for web development that I find both practical and creative. HTML allows me to structure content on the web, while CSS gives me the ability to design and style those structures, making them visually appealing and user-friendly. Together, they form the backbone of the web, and I love how they enable me to bring my ideas to life in a meaningful way.

These languages, each with their unique strengths, have shaped my journey as a developer, and I’m excited to continue exploring their potential as I grow in my career.
