        <p><span>I'm passionate about web development, creating user-friendly digital experiences, and learning new technologies. </span></p>
        <p><span>I enjoy building meaningful applications that solve real-world problems. Started coding in 2021, and now I'm a third-year IT student, honing my skills in web and app development. My journey began with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I quickly became fascinated with how technologies work together to bring ideas to life.</span></p>
        <p><span>I'm currently expanding my knowledge in Flutter, mobile app development, and backend technologies to build robust and interactive applications. Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.</span></p>
        <p><span>Beyond coding, I have a deep interest in UI/UX design, where I focus on creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing experiences for users. My goal is to bridge the gap between design and technology to create seamless, innovative digital solutions.</span></p>
